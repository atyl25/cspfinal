    <p>I took the following classes:</p>
    <p> Modern World History <br> Calculus <br> Computer Science <br> Chemistry <br> English <br> Chinese <br> Health Science (1/2-year) </p>
    <p>I also took several AP exams in May. The chemistry exam was the most challenging because I needed to do a lot of additional study outside of class.</p>
