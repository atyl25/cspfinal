    <p>I took the following classes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>History</li>
        <li>Calculus</li>
        <li>Computer science</li>
        <li>Chemistry</li>
        <li>English</li>
        <li>Chinese</li>
        <li>Health science (1/2-year)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also took several AP exams in May. Chemistry was the most challenging because I needed to do a lot of additional study outside of class.</p>
