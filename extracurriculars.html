    <p><b><i> Piano</i></b><p>
	<p> I enjoy playing the piano. It helps me relax. (Except when I haven't practiced and my piano teacher gives me the stink eye…) Pieces I played recently include <I>Pathétique</I> by Beethoveen, <I>Fantaisie Impromptu</I> by Chopin, and <I>The Cat and the Mouse</I> by Copland. I also had a recital last weekend.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b><i> Speech & Debate</i></b><p>
    <p> I did speech and debate. I learned about different topics and current events. I went to some tournaments, including the James Logan Martin Luther King Invitational and the NPDL Fall Invitational. </p>
